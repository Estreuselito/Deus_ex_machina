# How to get started
Install a virtual environment in this project folder on the highest level, using ```python -m venv ML2``` in your command line. Then proceed to activate this environment using ```.\ML2\Scripts\activate.bat```, for macOS use instead ```source ./ML2/bin/activate```. Thereafter we can install all required packages with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. Doing so will install all the packages defined in the ```requirements.txt``` file. Once we are done with this environment (i.e. the packages have been installed) we can ```deactivate``` it.
