# How to get started
Install a virtual environment on the highest level of this project folder by typing ```python -m venv ML2``` in your command line (accessed through such tools as Git Bash, Windows Power Shell, or the Command Prompt). Windows users should then proceed to activate this environment by inserting ```.\ML2\Scripts\activate.bat``` to their command line; for macOS use ```source ./ML2/bin/activate``` instead. Thereafter we can install all the required packages with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. Doing so will install all the packages defined in the ```requirements.txt``` file. Once we are done with this environment (i.e. the packages have been installed) we can ```deactivate``` it.
