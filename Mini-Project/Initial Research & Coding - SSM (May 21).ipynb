    "### K-means\n",
    "K-means is going to throw points into clusters whether they belong or not; it also assumes you clusters are globular. K-Means scores very poorly on this point. **Intuitive parameters**: If you have a good intuition for how many clusters the dataset your exploring has then great, otherwise you might have a problem. **Stability**: Hopefully the clustering is stable for your data. Best to have many runs and check though. **Performance**: This is K-Means's big win. Itâ€™s a simple algorithm and with the right tricks and optimizations can be made exceptionally efficient. There are few algorithms that can compete with K-Means for performance. If you have truly huge data then K-Means might be your only option.\n",

    "- Alternatively, writing \"%%latex\" can make the entire cell be in math mode.\n",
    "- Just like there is hard and soft classification, there is also hard and soft clustering. Soft clustering is where a given point is both in Cluster A and Cluster B, likely in different (i.e. weighted proportions). One type of well-known soft clustering algorithm are Gaussian Mixture Models. "
