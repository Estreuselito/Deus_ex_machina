    "# Partition Clustering\n",
    "A key characteristic of Partition Clustering algorithms is that they require the user to specify the number of clusters which the algorithm will find. Possessing at least some degree of domain knowledge and/or insight into the dataset is quite helpful in this regard, as otherwise the number of clusters formed is arbitrary and hence is not likely to reflect the inherent number of clusters within the data. On the other hand, the fact the programmer specifies the number of clusters to be identified does help Partition Clustering algorithms to be relatively efficient (computationally) when compared with other clustering algorithms. Partition Clustering algorithms cluster all data points, regardless if a given data point could be reliably said to be part of a cluster."

    "## K-means\n",
    "### General Description & Application\n",
    "K-means is a very popular Partition Clustering algorithm. Essentially, the user specifies the number of clusters to be identified, and the algorithm iteratively adjusts the clusters by moving what are known as **Centroids** in a manner that minimizes the distance of the data points to the Centroid to which they are assigned. In so doing the specific Centroid to which a given datapoint is assigned can change, as the datapoints are assigned to the nearest Centroid and as mentioned the Centroids iteratively change locations accordingly.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The major benefit of K-means is its minimal computational cost - it is a relatively simple and efficient algorithm that is well-suited to working with large datasets. However, as discussed in the description of Partition Clustering algorithms more broadly this can also be a downside, especially without domain knowledge and/or insight into the dataset. Furthermore, as with other Partition Clustering algorithms the K-means algorithm will assign all points to a cluster, irrespective of whether a given point is actually part of a cluster. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "The K-means algorithm can be broken down into four specific steps: \n",
    "1. Determine K, the number of clusters to be identified.\n",
    "2. Select K data points to serve as the initial centroids.\n",
    "3. Assign each data point to the closest centroid.\n",
    "4. Move the centroids according to the new \"average location\" of the data points assigned to each centroid. $\\newline$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\underline{Note}$: Steps 3 and 4 are repeated until there are no further changes to the clusters to which each data point is assigned or once the `max_iter` parameter has been reached. In order try and find a global rather than a local maximum, the algorithm is initialized with different centroid seeds `n_init` times, meaning that the total number of times the algorithms is effectuated is the product of the `n_init` and `max_iter` parameters.\n",

    "### General Description & Application\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of spectral clustering is rooted in graph theory. The spectral clustering algorithm aims to identify communities of nodes in a graph based on connections between them. It can be understood as aiming to maximize the number of within-cluster connections and to minimize the number of between-cluster connections. The spectral clustering algorithm also allows for clustering of non graph data. Thus, points that are (immediately) next to each other, i.e. closely connected, are identified in dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectral clustering algorithm utilizes information from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Laplacian Matrix. The calculation of the (unnormalized) Laplacian Matrix will be explained in more detail in a bit. In the end, a standard clustering algorithm, such as KMeans, is applied on the relevant eigenvectors of the Laplacian Matrix to identify clusters in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now briefly outline some advantages and disadvantages of the spectral clustering algorithm. The spectral clustering algorithm is generally able to capture complex data structures as it does not make an assumption about the shape/form of the clusters. Nevertheless, the spectral clustering algorithm still requires us to specify the number of clusters beforehand as indicated by the `n_cluster` hyperparamter. In that sense, it has the same disadvantage as K-Means. Furthermore, the spectral clustering algorithm groups every individual data point to a cluster, which means it may also cluster noise. Additionally, it is computationally expensive for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "The general process of the spectral clustering algorithm implemented in [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering.html) with the function `sklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering` can be illustrated by the following steps:\n",
    "1. Construct the Affinity Matrix based on the datapoints\n",
    "2. Create the Degree Matrix based on the Affinity Matrix\n",
    "3. Construct the Laplacian Matrix by subtracting the Affinity matrix from the Degree Matrix\n",
    "4. Eigendecomposition of the Laplacian Matrix\n",
    "5. Apply a standard clustering algorithm, e.g. KMeans, on the relevant eigenvectors of the Laplacian Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "The previously outlined steps will now be described in more detail: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Affinity Matrix \n",
    "The entries of an Affinity Matrix show how similar points are to each other. The higher the entry in a Affinity Matrix, the higher the similarity between the points. The Affinity Matrix can be constructed in different ways. Therefore, Scikit-Learn's [implementation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering.html#sklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering)  includes the parameter *affinity*, which defines how to construct the Affinity Matrix. Four options are available: `nearest_neighbors`, `rbf`, `precomputed`and `precomputed_nearest_neighbors`.\n",
    "- `nearest_neighbors` constructs the affinity matrix by computing a graph of nearest neighbors. If chosen, the hyperparameter `n_neighbors` also needs to be set as this determines the number of neighbors to use when constructing the affinity matrix.\n",
    "- `rbf` constructs the affinity matrix using a radial basis function (RBF) kernel\n",
    "- `precomputed` interprets X as a precomputed affinity matrix, where larger values indicate greater similarity between instances\n",
    "- `precomputed_nearest_neighbors` interprets X as a sparse graph of precomputed distances, and construct a binary affinity matrix from the n_neighbors nearest neighbors of each instance\n",
    "\n",
    "It will now be detailed, how the Affinity Matrix is constructed using `nearest_neighbors` and `rbf`, i.e. in those cases where no precomputed Affinity Matrix is provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "**nearest_neighbors:**  \n",
    "When setting the parameter *affinity* to `nearest_neighbors`, the Affinity Matrix is calculated using the k-nearest neighbors method. Thus, the number of neighbors to use when constructing the Affinity Matrix needs to be specified with the parameter `n_neighbors`. Let's call the matrix, which stores the relationships of k-nearest neighbours, *Connectivity Matrix*. If another datapoint belongs to the k-nearest neighbors, the Connectivity Matrix will indicate it with an entry of 1. If it does not belong to the k-nearest neighbors, it will be indicated with a 0. In Scikit-Learn, the Affinity Matrix is then calculated using the following [formula](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/aa898de885ed4861a03e4f79b28f92f70914643d/sklearn/cluster/_spectral.py#L512):\n",

    "- `1.0` indicates that when calculating the closest k-nearest neighbors, both datapoints were amongst the respective nearest k-datapoints \n",
    "- `0.5` indicates that this was only true for one datapoint, i.e. only in one \"direction\"\n",
    "- `0.0` indicates that for both datapoints, the other respective datapoint was not among the k-nearest\n",

    "*Note*: The parameter `include_self` is set to *True*, which means that each sample is marked as the first nearest neighbor to [itself](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/aa898de885ed4861a03e4f79b28f92f70914643d/sklearn/cluster/_spectral.py#L510).\n",

    "The Degree Matrix is a diagonal matrix, which is obtained by taking the sum of each row in the Affinity Matrix. The entries on the diagonal are called *degree*. Thus, the closer the individual points are group together, the higher the entry in the diagonal as each individual entry in the rows of the Affinity Matrix will be larger. At the same time, if the points are spread out further, the individual entries in the rows of the Affinity Matrix are smaller, which in turn leads to a smaller sum of the row.\n",

    "#### Step 4: Eigendecomposition of Laplacian Matrix\n",
    "In the next step, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Laplacian Matrix are calculated. As already outlined in our introduction to *Partition Clustering*, determining the number clusters in a dataset is generally a difficult task. Similar to the *elbow plot*, which may be used when determining the \"right\" number of clusters for the KMeans algorithm, we can make use of the eigengap heuristic in spectral clustering. The goal is to identify the first large gap between the eigenvalues, which are ordered increasingly. Thus, we choose the number of clusters such that all eigenvalues $λ_1$,..., $λ_k$ are minuscule and $λ_{k+1}$ is comparatively large. The number of eigenvalues $λ_1$,..., $λ_k$ before this gap generally correspond to the number of clusters in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen by the following stylized examples, we can identify a gap between eigenvalues number two and three as well as between number four and five, which in turn helps to determine the \"right\" number of clusters. \n",

    "Thoses examples are just for illustration of the eigengap heuristic. Here, kmeans could easily be applied and would yield a good and fast solution. Furthermore, it has to be noted that the parameter `n_cluster` needs to be specified before the spectral clustering algorithm is run. Thus, the visualization of the eigengap heuristic is just used to illustrate the information content of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian Matrix. It should not be understood as a step, which can be performed when calling `sklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Application of standard clustering algorithm \n",
    "The k eigenvectors associated with the k smallest eigenvalues are used for the partitioning of the dataset, except for the eigenvector corresponding to the first eigenvalue as this eigenvalue will always have a value of zero (see properties further above). A standard clustering algorithm is applied on the set of eigenvectors. The default clustering algorithm is KMeans.\n",

    "Hierarchical Clustering algorithms create a hierarchy of clusters using a predefined distance metric such as Single-Link (comparing the observation to the closest point in each cluster) vs. Complete-Link (comparing the observations to the farthest point in each cluster). Hierarchical Clustering algorithms will stop running when either (1) the specified number of clusters has been obtained, or (2) the linkage distance threshold has been reached. As with Partition Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering algorithms cluster all observations in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, we can think of an entire dataset as being a single cluster, irrespective of how dispersely the datapoints contained therein are distributed. Along a similar train of thought, the most granular way to cluster a dataset would be to assign each datapoint to its own cluster; in the context of Hierarchical Clustering these are known as **singletons**. So, with hierarchical clustering algorithms what we have is a way to outline the different ways in which a given dataset can be clustered, ranging from a single cluster that contains the entire dataset to *n* clusters where *n* is equal to the number of datapoints. This range or \"hierarchy\" of clusters can be thought of as representing different degrees of granularity in terms of the similarity between the data points, where the singletons are the most granular groupings as each data point has its own cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical clustering algorithms can be further categorized based on whether a **top-down** or a **bottom-up** approach is used to cluster the data. With a top-down approach, the algorithm starts with the dataset as a whole (one cluster) and iteratively breaks it down into increasingly smaller clusters. Conversely, with a bottom-up approach the algorithm starts with the singletons as individual clusters (that is the initialization step) and iteratively combines them into ever-larger clusters. As mentioned, the deciding factor in terms of how the hierarchy of the clusters is formed is the stipulated distance metric, irrespective of whether a top-down or a  bottom-up approach is followed.\n",

    "## BIRCH\n",
    "### General Description & Application\n",
    "\n",
    "BIRCH is an acronym for **B**alanced **I**terative **R**educing and **C**lustering using **H**ierarchies. The algorithm was introduced in 1996 by Tian Zhang, Raghu Ramakrishnan and Miron Livny in their [article](https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/459/han/papers/zhang96.pdf) *BIRCH: An Efficient Data Clustering Method for Very Large Databases*. \n",
    "\n",
    "As can already be inferred from the title, BIRCH is designed for clustering of very large datasets. BIRCH takes into account that the amount of memory is generally limited, i.e. the size of the dataset generally exceeds the available memory. Thus, BIRCH aims to minimize I/O costs as it does not require to memorize the entire data set. The algorithm can yield a satisfactory clustering of the data set with just a single scan of the data set. To increase the performance, just a few additional scans of the data set are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "BIRCH belongs to the category of Hierarchical Clustering algorithms. In contrast to Agglomerative Clustering, it uses a top-down-approach instead of a bottom-up-approach. The *Clustering-Feature (CF)* and the *CF-Tree* are two key concepts of the algorithm. Based on the data set, BIRCH constructs a *Clustering Feature Tree (CF-Tree)*. The CF-Tree consists of *Clustering Feature nodes (CF Nodes)*, which in turn contain *Clustering Features*. Clustering Features basically summarize relevant statistical metrics for the given cluster. Thus, BIRCH allows for clustering of larger datasets by first generating a compact summary of the large dataset that preserves as much information as possible. Secondy, this summary is then clustered instead of clustering the entire, i.e. larger, dataset. Both, *CF-Trees* and *Clustering Features* will be explained in more detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the main advantage of BIRCH is its scalability as it yields satisfactory results in a comparatively small amount of time for very large datasets. Its time complexity is $=O(n)$, where n\n",
    "equals the number of objects to be clustered. One disadvantage of BIRCH is that it can only metric attributes, i.e. no categorical variables. Moreover, if the shape of the clusters are not spherical, the algorithm may not perform well as it utilizes the radius to control the boundary of a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CF-Tree\n",
    "The [CF-Tree](https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/459/han/papers/zhang96.pdf) is a \"height-balanced tree with two parameters: branching factor B and threshold T.\" The following [picture](http://avid.cs.umass.edu/courses/745/f2010/notes/DataMining.htm) depicts an example of the structure of a CF-Tree:\n",

    "\n",
    "Naturally, internal nodes or non-leaf nodes of the CF-tree have descendants or \"children\". They take the form $[CF_i, child_i]$, where $i = 1, 2, ..., B$. Thus, each non-leaf node contains at maximum *B* entries, where *B* represents the branching factor and each entry one associated subcluster. In turn, $B$ also affects the size of the CF-Tree. The larger *B*, the smaller the CF-Tree. In `sklearn.cluster.Birch`, the branching factor *B* is represented by the hyperparameter `branching_factor`. The Clustering Features, $CF_i$, store the information about the descendants, i.e. the subclusters, while $child_i$ is used as a pointer to the i-th child/descendant. Thus, the Clustering Feature, $CF_i$, contains the sums of all Clustering Features of $child_i$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The leaf nodes are of the form $[CF_i]$. Furthermore, each leaf node has two entries \"prev\" and \"next\", which are used to connect all leaf nodes. This chain allows for efficient scans. A leaf node contains at most *L* entries. While each entry in leaf nodes also represents an associated subcluster, i.e. equivalent to non-leaf nodes, the entries have additionally to comply to the treshold requirement *T*. The radius of the subcluster represented by each entry has to be smaller than *T*. In turn, the threshold *T* also affects the size of the CF-Tree. With a smaller threshold, the size of the CF-tree will increase and with a larger threshold, the size of the CF-tree will decrease. In `sklearn.cluster.Birch`, the threshold *T* can be adjusted with the hyperparameter `threshold`. \n",

    "The CF-Tree is built dynamically as new data points are added. Thus, the CF-Tree directs a new insertion into the correct subcluster similar to a B+-Tree, which sorts new data points into their correct position. In the following, the general steps of the insertion of an entry (data point or subcluster) into the CF-Tree are described:<br>\n",
    "**1. Identifying the appropriate leaf:**<br>\n",
    "Starting from the top of the CF-Tree, i.e. the root, the algorithm recursively descends down the CF-Tree to find the closest child node based on a certain distance metric. In `sklearn.cluster.Birch`, Euclidean Distance is [used](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/15a949460dbf19e5e196b8ef48f9712b72a3b3c3/sklearn/cluster/_birch.py#L73).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Modifying the leaf:**<br>\n",
    "Once the leaf node, e.g. $CF_8$, is reached, the closest leaf-entry, e.g. $CF_{96}$, in that node is found. Afterwards, it is checked if $CF_{96}$ can absord the new entry without violating the threshold requirement *T*. If it can, i.e. the radius of $CF_{96}$ remains smaller than *T* even after adding the new entry, $CF_{96}$ will be updated. If adding the entry would lead to a violation of the threshold requirement *T*, a new entry for a Clustering Feature, i.e. $CF_i$, will be added to the leaf. This can only be done if there is space for another entry on the leaf, i.e. the number of Clustering Features on that leaf is smaller than *L*. Otherwise, the leaf node is splitted. The node is splitted by choosing the pair of entries which are the farthest apart as seeds. All other entries are then redistribution to the closest one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Modifying the path to the leaf:**<br>\n",
    "As we previously outlined, every internal, i.e. non-leaf, node is composed of the Clustering Features of all its descendants. Thus, upon inserting an entry into a leaf node, the information for each internal node on the path towards the leaf node needs to be updated. If the leaf-node was splitted in the previous step, a new non-leaf entry is inserted into the parent node. This newly inserted entry at the parent node will point to the newly created leaf in the previous step. Here, the branching factor *B* must be adherred to. If the parent node does not have enough space as it already contains *B* entries, the parent node must be split as well. This splitting is performed up to the root.  \n",
