    "With the introduction of noise to the data, i.e. through $\\sigma_{Recovered}$, $\\sigma_{Infected}$ and $\\sigma_{Dead}$, individual data points may exceed the value of 1.0. Furthermore, for a certain point in time the sum of R(t), I(t) and D(t) may exceed the amount of 1.0. This contradicts reality as the size of the population can not exceed 100%, i.e. 1. Thus, the compartments *recovered*, *infected* and *dead* should maximally yield a sum of 1, which in turn corresponds to the amount of *suceptibles* being 0. In order to address this issue, the modelling of noise would need to be adjusted, e.g. by introducing a constraint. As this did not significantly effect the second part of our assignment, we did not chose to alter the modelling of noise. Nevertheless, it is important to keep this shortcoming in mind if applied to other tasks."
