Welcome to our Machine Learning II Book
============================

Within this book are all our beautiful Assignments displayed. Those reach from creating a SIRD model, over looking into PCAs and
ends up with Markov Chain Monte Carlo and a lengthy explanation of the PYMC3 syntax. There is much more to experience, so please feel
free to dive in.
