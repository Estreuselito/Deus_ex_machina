Essentially, you can draw a line between each vector pair, and this line represents the distance between each pair. Distance, in turn, is a measure of similarity, with lesser distances indicating greater similarity and vice versa.

It uses a random matrix to perform the projection and hence the name random projection.\n",

If the sparse projection matrix has c nonzero entries per column, then the complexity of the projection operation is of order O(ckN) instead of O(dkN), where N is the number of observations."
